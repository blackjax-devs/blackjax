# Examples

The Blackjax repository provides examples in the form of Markdown documents. [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) can be used by the users to convert their Jupyter notebooks to this format, or convert these documents to Jupyter notebooks. Examples are rendered in the [documentation](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/).


## For users

### Load examples in a Jupyter notebook

To convert any example file to a Jupyter notebook you can use:

```shell
jupytext examples/your_example_file.md --to notebook
```

you can then interact with the resulting notebook just like with any notebook.


## For contributors

### Convert my Jupyter notebook to markdown

If you implemented your example in a Jupyter notebook you can convert your `.ipynb` file to Markdown using the command below:

```shell
jupytext example/your_example_notebook.ipynb --to myst
```

Once the example file is converted to a Markdown file, you have two options for editing:

1. Edit the Markdown version as it is a regular Markdown file.
2. Edit the Notebook version then convert it to a Markdown file once you finish editing with the command above. Jupytext can handle the change if the example has the same file name.

**Please make sure to only commit the  Markdown file.**

## Composing Documentation on Sphinx-Doc

We use `Sphinx` to generate document for this repo. We highly encourage you to check how your changes to the examples are rendered in the documentation:

1. Add your documentation to `docs/examples.rst`
2. Run the command below:

```shell
 make build-docs
```

3. Check the generated documentation in `docs/builds`

### Execution Times

`Sphinx` handles the conversion from Markdown to the rendered pages. The table below shows the execution times of example notebooks on a laptop to give you an idea of what to expect:

|Examples                       | Execution Time (seconds) |
