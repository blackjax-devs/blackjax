    """The general mclmc kernel builder (:meth:`blackjax.mcmc.mclmc.build_kernel`, alias `blackjax.mclmc.build_kernel`) can be
    cumbersome to manipulate. Since most users only need to specify the kernel
    parameters at initialization time, we provide a helper function that
    specializes the general kernel.

    We also add the general kernel and state generator as an attribute to this class so
    users only need to pass `blackjax.mclmc` to SMC, adaptation, etc. algorithms.

    Examples
    --------

    A new mclmc kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

    .. code::

        mclmc = blackjax.mcmc.mclmc.mclmc(
            logdensity_fn=logdensity_fn,
            L=L,
            step_size=step_size
        )
        state = mclmc.init(position)
        new_state, info = mclmc.step(rng_key, state)

    Kernels are not jit-compiled by default so you will need to do it manually:

    .. code::

        step = jax.jit(mclmc.step)
        new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

    Parameters
    ----------
    logdensity_fn
        The log-density function we wish to draw samples from.
    L
        the momentum decoherence rate
    step_size
        step size of the integrator
    integrator
        an integrator. We recommend using the default here.

    Returns
    -------
    A ``SamplingAlgorithm``.
