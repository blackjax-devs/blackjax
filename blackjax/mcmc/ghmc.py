    to perform a non-reversible Metropolis Hastings update, thus we also
    store the current slice variable and return its updated version after
    each iteration. To make computations more efficient, we also store
    the current potential energy as well as the current gradient of the

    The Generalized HMC kernel performs a similar procedure to the standard HMC
    kernel with the difference of a persistent momentum variable and a non-reversible
    Metropolis-Hastings step instead of the standard Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
    step. This means that; apart from momentum and slice variables that are dependent
    on the previous momentum and slice variables, and a Metropolis-Hastings step
    performed (equivalently) as slice sampling; the standard HMC's implementation can
    be re-used to perform Generalized HMC sampling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    noise_fn
        A function that takes as input the slice variable and outputs a random
        variable used as a noise correction of the persistent slice update.
        The parameter defaults to a random variable with a single atom at 0.
    divergence_threshold
        Value of the difference in energy above which we consider that the
        transition is divergent.

    Returns
    -------
    A kernel that takes a rng_key, a Pytree that contains the current state
    of the chain, and free parameters of the sampling mechanism; and that
    returns a new state of the chain along with information about the transition.
