- should think carefully about the core of the algo:
  - for direction generation we're generating (malhanobis) unit vectors
    - these should shrink with the nested sampling loop
    - we may want to determine the (dimension specific) optimal vector, or tune it manually
    - should mention this in paper
- type hinting
  - float vs ArrayTree vs ArrayLikeTree ? 
- delete_fn should be an argument
  - perhaps in place of n_delete at base? 
- should mcmc_init_fn have placeholder NotImplementedError?
- StateWithParameterOverride
  - this seems less than consistent 
- are we sure adaptive init is doing the right thing? 
- mcmc_ ? should we just call this 'inner kernel'?
- discuss unravel_fn implementation
- nlive calculation:
  - much more explicit than my version (which was just to treat nans as -infs for this case, which works wlog)
  - possibly could be a bit shorter
- sample:
  - n_samples -> shape?
