"""
Implements the (basic) user interfaces for Random Walk Rosenbluth-Metropolis-Hastings kernels.
Some interfaces are exposed here for convenience and for entry level users, who might be familiar
with simpler versions of the algorithms, but in all cases they are particular instantiations
of the Random Walk Rosenbluth-Metropolis-Hastings.

Let's note $x_{t-1}$ to the previous position and $x_t$ to the newly sampled one.

The variants offered are:

1. Proposal distribution as addition of random noice from previous position. This means
   $x_t = x_{t-1} + step$.

    Function: `additive_step`

2. Independent proposal distribution: $P(x_t)$ doesn't depend on $x_{t_1}$.

    Function: `irmh`

3. Proposal distribution using a symmetric function. That means $P(x_t|x_{t-1}) = P(x_{t-1}|x_t)$.
   See 'Metropolis Algorithm' in [1].

    Function: `rmh` without proposal_logdensity_fn.

4. Asymmetric proposal distribution. See 'Metropolis-Hastings' Algorithm in [1].

    Function: `rmh` with proposal_logdensity_fn.

Reference: :cite:p:`gelman2014bayesian` Section 11.2

Examples
--------
    The simplest case is:

    .. code::

        random_walk = blackjax.additive_step_random_walk(logdensity_fn, blackjax.mcmc.random_walk.normal(sigma))
        state = random_walk.init(position)
        new_state, info = random_walk.step(rng_key, state)

    In all cases we can JIT-compile the step function for better performance

    .. code::

        step = jax.jit(random_walk.step)
        new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)
