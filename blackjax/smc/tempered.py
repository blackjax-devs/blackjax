    Tempered SMC uses tempering to sample from a distribution given by

    .. math::
        p(x) \\propto p_0(x) \\exp(-V(x)) \\mathrm{d}x

    where :math:`p_0` is the prior distribution, typically easy to sample from
    and for which the density is easy to compute, and :math:`\\exp(-V(x))` is an
    unnormalized likelihood term for which :math:`V(x)` is easy to compute
    pointwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logprior_fn
        A function that computes the log density of the prior distribution
    loglikelihood_fn
        A function that returns the probability at a given
        position.
    mcmc_step_fn
        A function that creates a mcmc kernel from a log-probability density function.
    mcmc_init_fn: Callable
        A function that creates a new mcmc state from a position and a
        log-probability density function.
    resampling_fn
        A random function that resamples generated particles based of weights
    num_mcmc_iterations
        Number of iterations in the MCMC chain.

    Returns
    -------
    A callable that takes a rng_key and a TemperedSMCState that contains the current state
    of the chain and that returns a new state of the chain along with
    information about the transition.
