    max_delta: float

    root_solver: Callable, optional
        A solver to find the root of a function, takes a function `f`, a starting point `delta0`,
        a min value `min_delta`, and a max value `max_delta`.
        Default is `BFGS` minimization of `f ** 2` and ignores `min_delta` and `max_delta`.
    use_log_ess: bool
        Solve using the log ESS or the ESS directly. This may have different behaviours based on the potential function.

    Returns
    -------
    delta: float
        The increment that solves for the target ESS
