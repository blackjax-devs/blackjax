    It is possible to compute the variance of a population of values in an
    on-line fashion to avoid storing intermediate results. The naive recurrence
    relations between the sample mean and variance at a step and the next are
    however not numerically stable.

    Welford's algorithm uses the sum of square of differences
    :math:`M_{2,n} = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(x_i-\overline{x_n}\right)^2`
    for updating where :math:`x_n` is the current mean and the following

    Parameters
    ----------
    is_diagonal_matrix

        (default), otherwise adaps and returns a dense mass matrix.
