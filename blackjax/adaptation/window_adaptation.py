    """Warmup scheme for sampling procedures based on euclidean manifold HMC.
    The schedule and algorithms used match Stan's [1]_ as closely as possible.

    Unlike several other libraries, we separate the warmup and sampling phases
    explicitly. This ensure a better modularity; a change in the warmup does
    not affect the sampling. It also allows users to run their own warmup
    should they want to.
    We also decouple generating a new sample with the mcmc algorithm and
    updating the values of the parameters.

    Stan's warmup consists in the three following phases:

    1. A fast adaptation window where only the step size is adapted using
    Nesterov's dual averaging scheme to match a target acceptance rate.
    2. A succession of slow adapation windows (where the size of a window is
    double that of the previous window) where both the mass matrix and the step
    size are adapted. The mass matrix is recomputed at the end of each window;
    the step size is re-initialized to a "reasonable" value.
    3. A last fast adaptation window where only the step size is adapted.

    Schematically:

    +---------+---+------+------------+------------------------+------+
    |  fast   | s | slow |   slow     |        slow            | fast |
    +---------+---+------+------------+------------------------+------+
    |1        |2  |3     |3           |3                       |3     |
    +---------+---+------+------------+------------------------+------+

    Step (1) consists in find a "reasonable" first step size that is used to
    initialize the dual averaging scheme. In (2) we initialize the mass matrix
    to the matrix. In (3) we compute the mass matrix to use in the kernel and
    re-initialize the mass matrix adaptation. The step size is still adapated
    in slow adaptation windows, and is not re-initialized between windows.

    The schedule below is intended to be as close as possible to Stan's _[1].
    The warmup period is split into three stages:

    1. An initial fast interval to reach the typical set. Only the step size is
    adapted in this window.
    2. "Slow" parameters that require global information (typically covariance)
    are estimated in a series of expanding intervals with no memory; the step
    size is re-initialized at the end of each window. Each window is twice the
    size of the preceding window.
    3. A final fast interval during which the step size is adapted using the
    computed mass matrix.

    Schematically:

    ```
    +---------+---+------+------------+------------------------+------+
    |  fast   | s | slow |   slow     |        slow            | fast |
    +---------+---+------+------------+------------------------+------+
    ```

    The distinction slow/fast comes from the speed at which the algorithms
    converge to a stable value; in the common case, estimation of covariance
    requires more steps than dual averaging to give an accurate value. See _[1]
    for a more detailed explanation.

    Fast intervals are given the label 0 and slow intervals the label 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_steps: int
        The number of warmup steps to perform.
    initial_buffer: int
        The width of the initial fast adaptation interval.
    first_window_size: int
        The width of the first slow adaptation interval.
    final_buffer_size: int
        The width of the final fast adaptation interval.
