    Sampling algorithms often need to carry over some informations between
    steps, often to avoid computing the same quantity twice. Therefore the
    kernels do not operate on the chain positions themselves, but on states that
    contain this position and other information.

    The `InitFn` returns the state corresponding to a chain position. This state
    can then be passed to the `update` function of the `SamplingAlgorithm`.

    about the transtion.

    Update functions is a simplified yet universal interface with every sampling
    algorithm. In essence, what all these algorithms do is take a rng state, a
    chain state (possibly a batch of data) and return a new state and some
    information about the transition.

    Blackjax sampling algorithms are implemented as a pair of pure functions: a

    initialization function that creates a kernel state from a chain position.

    As they represent Markov kernels, the kernel functions are pure functions
    and do not have internal state. To save computation time they also operate
    on states which contain the chain state and additional information that
    needs to be carried over for the next step.

    ---------
    init:
        A pure function which when called with the initial position and the
